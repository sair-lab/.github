# 🙋‍♀️ Welcome to the SAIR Lab 🙌

- We research Spatial AI and Robotics.

- Our research goal is to achieve **human-level spatial awareness** and **reasoning** on **robotic systems**.

- We are interested in all aspects of algorithm development, including creating **efficient algorithms**,
proving their **theoretical properties**, distributing them to **open-source communities**, and validating
them on **real-world robots**.
