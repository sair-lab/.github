## 🙋‍♀️ Welcome to SAIR Lab 🙌
 
- At the intersection of **perception**, **spatial reasoning**, and **decision-making**, we are committed to advancing mobile robots toward **human-level autonomy** by developing **algorithms and systems** that can **efficiently** and **robustly**:

  - Perceive and interpret various sensory inputs such as images, point clouds, and proprioceptive data.
  - Integrate neural and symbolic memory representations to capture spatial common sense and semantic knowledge.
  - Reason, plan, and act in real time to navigate, interact, and adapt within unstructured and dynamic environments.

## About open-source.

- SAIR Lab is leading [PyPose](https://github.com/pypose/pypose), an open-source Python library for **differentiable robotics on manifolds**.
- This GitHub organization provides source code for **research** and **publications**.
- Teaching materials are available at GitHub organization [sairclass](https://github.com/sairclass).
