## 🙋‍♀️ Welcome to SAIR Lab 🙌

- Our research goal is to achieve **human-level spatial awareness** and **reasoning** on **robotic systems**.

- We are interested in all aspects of algorithm development, including creating **efficient algorithms**,
proving their **theoretical properties**, distributing them to **open-source communities**, and validating
them on **real-world robots**.

## About open-source.

- SAIR Lab is leading [PyPose](https://github.com/pypose/pypose), which is an open-source Python library for differentiable robotics.
- This GitHub organization provides source code for **publications** and **teaching materials**.
