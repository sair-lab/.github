## üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Welcome to the SAIR Lab üôå

- Our research goal is to achieve **human-level spatial awareness** and **reasoning** on **robotic systems**.

- We are interested in all aspects of algorithm development, including creating **efficient algorithms**,
proving their **theoretical properties**, distributing them to **open-source communities**, and validating
them on **real-world robots**.

## About open-source.

- SAIR Lab is also leading [PyPose](https://github.com/pypose/pypose), which is an open-source tool for robotics research.
- This orgnization provides all repos that are not directly related to [PyPose](https://github.com/pypose/pypose).
